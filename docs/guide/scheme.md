# Schemed Models

Wick Schemed Models provide a way define strict data patterns and interfaces that can be used to ensure consistant data flow between Components, Files, Clients and SErver. 

There are four intrinsic scheme data types provided by Wick:
Time 
Date
String
Number
Bool

When these are used in defining a schemed model, properties with these types will automatically coerce any value passed to the appropiate form.
